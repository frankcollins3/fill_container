# fill_container
Water app (based on class project) that views unfulfilled fluid intake as yet to be met whitespace %20 removal


bookmarking:
gray UI possibly with a non-obnoxious robot logo. The more empty the fluid intake bar is, the more gray the app UI will be. Fill with fluid and app becomes blue. 


Whatever gray-page logo || blue-page logo is: the gray logo fades out as page becomes blue and blue logo fades in. vice versa for reverse. day starts need intake.

bookmarking that I want to use browser task automation tool Puppeteer in some way for this app.
might: useEffect()=> puppeteer()-> maybe once every 3-7 days. weatherAPI.get() hot(>90deg) 3 day streak ? send user automated msg: drink extra X% water per day for X days (i.e. 1-3)
