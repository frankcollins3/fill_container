From GOOGLE: 
You typically get about 20% of the water you need from the food you eat. 
Taking that into account, women need about nine cups of fluid per day and men about 13 cups in order to help replenish the amount of water that is lost
// I believe sodium and potassium drain faster from body and that you would need to overcompensate with > 20%.
